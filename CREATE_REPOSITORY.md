# 🚀 Create GitHub Repository: Game_Test1

## Option 1: Create Repository on GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create the Repository
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `Game_Test1`
3. **Description**: `🧛‍♂️ SurvivorLite - Complete Vampire Survivors-style ARPG built in Unity`
4. **Visibility**: ✅ **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **Initialize**: ❌ **DO NOT** check any boxes (we have our own files)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Remove the old remote (if it exists)
git remote remove origin

# Add the correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kemerova/Game_Test1.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it)

```bash
# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create Kemerova/Game_Test1 --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Option 3: Different Repository Name

If you want to use a different name, just create a repository with any name you like:

```bash
# For example, if you create "SurvivorLite" instead:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kemerova/SurvivorLite.git
git push -u origin main
```
