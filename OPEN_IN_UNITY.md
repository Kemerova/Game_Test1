# 🎮 Open SurvivorLite in Unity Hub

## 🎯 Quick Fix (1 minute)

Unity Hub doesn't automatically detect projects in folders. You need to manually add them.

### Method 1: Add Project to Unity Hub (Recommended)
1. **Open Unity Hub**
2. **Click "Open"** (or "Add" button)
3. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\micha\Game Maker`
4. **Select the folder** (the one containing Assets, ProjectSettings, etc.)
5. **Click "Open"** or "Add"

### Method 2: Open Directly from File Explorer
1. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\micha\Game Maker`
2. **Double-click** any `.unity` scene file (we'll create one)
3. **Unity will open** and add the project automatically

## 🔧 Let's Create a Scene File

Since Unity Hub looks for scene files, let me create a basic scene:

### Step 1: Create Scenes Folder Structure
The project needs a default scene file for Unity Hub to recognize it properly.

### Step 2: Open in Unity
1. **Unity Hub** → **Open** → Select `C:\Users\micha\Game Maker`
2. **Unity will import** the project (may take 30-60 seconds)
3. **Run**: `SurvivorLite → Auto Setup Complete Scene` (from Unity menu)
4. **Press Play** ▶️

## 🎮 What Happens Next

Once Unity opens the project:
1. **Import process** - Unity will process all assets (30-60 seconds)
2. **Menu appears** - You'll see `SurvivorLite` in the Unity menu bar
3. **Auto setup** - Run the menu command to create the complete scene
4. **Play immediately** - Press Play button for instant gameplay

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Unity Hub Still Doesn't See It:
1. **Check Unity Version** - Needs Unity 2022.3+ LTS
2. **Try "Open"** instead of looking in recent projects
3. **Select the root folder** (the one with Assets/ and ProjectSettings/)

### If Import Takes Long:
- **Normal behavior** - First import can take 1-2 minutes
- **Unity is processing** all the scripts and assets
- **Wait for completion** before running the auto-setup

### If You Get Errors:
- **Check Unity version** - Must be 2022.3 or newer
- **Try safe mode** - Hold Alt while opening Unity
- **Reimport assets** - Assets → Reimport All

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ **Unity opens** with the project loaded
- ✅ **Console shows** no red errors
- ✅ **Menu bar** shows "SurvivorLite" option
- ✅ **Project window** shows Assets folder with Scripts
- ✅ **Scene view** is empty (ready for auto-setup)

**🎯 Just click "Open" in Unity Hub and navigate to your Game Maker folder! Unity will handle the rest! 🚀**
