## 📊 What's Working

This is a **complete, playable Vampire Survivors core loop**:

### Core Systems ✅

- XP collection and leveling
- Object pooling for performance
- UI with HP/XP bars and timer

### Analytics & Polish ✅

- Performance optimizations

### Missing (Week 2+)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If something doesn't work:**
1. **Check Console** for any red errors
2. **Try Menu**: `SurvivorLite → Auto Setup Complete Scene` again
3. **Verify Tags**: Player, Enemy, Projectile, Pickup should exist

**Performance:**
- Should run at 60 FPS easily
- CSV logs save to: `<persistentDataPath>/logs/`
- Memory usage stays stable with object pooling

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you've played and tested the core loop:

1. **Check the CSV logs** - see how weapons perform over time
2. **Implement Week 2** - Level-up UI and upgrade system  
3. **Add more content** - New weapons, enemies, effects
4. **Polish and ship** - Menus, builds, deployment

**The foundation is rock-solid!** All the hard architectural work is done. You can now focus on content and balance.
